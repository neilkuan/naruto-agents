# AgentOS

A multi-agent operating system built on [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). A central coordinator (Chief) routes tasks to specialist agents, each with its own identity, memory, and skills.

## How It Works

**Kakashi（卡卡西）** acts as a COO — every request lands on his desk first. He either handles the task directly or delegates to the right specialist:

| Agent | Code Name | Handles |
|---|---|---|
| **@dev** | Naruto（鳴人） | Feature requests, bug fixes, code reviews, architecture |
| **@ops** | Yamato（大和） | CI/CD pipelines, deployment, infrastructure, monitoring |
| **@writer** | Jiraiya（自來也） | Documentation, blog posts, emails, content editing |
| **@researcher** | Shikamaru（鹿丸） | Research questions, competitive analysis, fact-checking |
| **@pm** | Tsunade（綱手） | Project planning, task breakdowns, progress tracking, knowledge org |

Each agent runs in an independent context window with its own `CLAUDE.md`, memory, and skills. Chief synthesizes results and reports back.

### Multi-Agent Coordination

For tasks spanning multiple domains, Chief decomposes the work and delegates in parallel:

- Code + deployment → Naruto writes the code, Yamato handles the pipeline
- Research → plan → implement → Shikamaru → Tsunade → Naruto
- Each agent flags cross-team dependencies for Chief to coordinate

## Key Features

- **Smart Routing** — Chief reads the request and delegates to the best-fit agent
- **Persistent Memory** — Each agent maintains its own memory for patterns, lessons, and context
- **Auto Reflection** — Every agent writes a daily log after completing significant tasks (mandatory behavior, not optional)
- **Cross-Agent Collaboration** — Agents flag when work needs another specialist, Chief coordinates
- **Extensible Skills** — SOPs as markdown files, shared or agent-specific

## Available Skills

| Skill | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Triage | `skills/triage.md` | Classify requests and route to the right agent |
| Morning Briefing | `skills/morning-briefing.md` | Daily startup overview |
| Code Review | `skills/code-review.md` | Structured code review process |
| Weekly Summary | `skills/weekly-summary.md` | Weekly progress rollup |

## Getting Started

1. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `claude` in the project root — Chief loads automatically

```bash
git clone git@github.com:allen-hsu/agent-os.git
cd agent-os
claude
```

## Scheduled Tasks

You can use standard cron or Claude Code's built-in scheduling to run recurring tasks (e.g., a daily Morning Briefing).

### Option 1: Local cron + Claude CLI

Add to your crontab (`crontab -e`):

```bash
# Morning Briefing — every day at 9am
0 9 * * * cd /Users/you/agent-os && claude -p "Execute Morning Briefing: read memory/daily/ for recent team logs, read memory/MEMORY.md for priorities, check each agent's memory/daily/ for activity, and output a concise daily briefing." >> /tmp/morning-briefing.log 2>&1
```

**Requirements**: Machine must be on, Claude CLI installed.

### Option 2: In-session cron (testing only)

Inside a Claude Code session, ask Chief to create a temporary scheduled task:

```
Run Morning Briefing every 10 minutes
```

This uses Claude Code's built-in `CronCreate` — session-only, auto-expires after 7 days.

### Available Scheduled Tasks

| Task | Skill File | Suggested Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| Morning Briefing | `skills/morning-briefing.md` | Daily at 9am |
| Weekly Summary | `skills/weekly-summary.md` | Weekly on Monday at 9am |

## Adding New Agents

Use the template at `templates/new-agent.md` to scaffold a new specialist agent. Each agent needs:

- `CLAUDE.md` — Identity, principles, tools, memory, skills
- `IDENTITY.md` — Brief summary for Chief's routing decisions
- `memory/MEMORY.md` — Persistent knowledge index
